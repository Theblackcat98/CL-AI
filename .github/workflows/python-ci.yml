  # Optional: Job to build and publish to PyPI
  # This job will only run when a new tag is pushed (e.g., v0.1.0)
  # You will need to configure PyPI API token in your repository secrets (PYPI_API_TOKEN)
  # publish:
  #   needs: build # ensure build and tests pass before publishing

  #   - name: Set up Python

# To enable publishing:
# 1. Uncomment the "publish" job above.
# 2. Go to your GitHub repository's Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
# 3. Create a new repository secret named `PYPI_API_TOKEN`.
# 4. Generate an API token on PyPI (https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/) and paste its value into the secret.
#    Make sure the token has permissions to upload to your specific project if possible, or to all projects if necessary.
# 5. When you want to release a new version:
#    a. Update the version number in `pyproject.toml`.
#    b. Commit and push the change.
#    c. Create a new Git tag matching the version (e.g., `git tag v0.1.1`, `git push origin v0.1.1`).
#    This will trigger the publish job.
